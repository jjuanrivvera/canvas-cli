## canvas webhook

Manage Canvas webhook listeners

### Synopsis

Start and manage webhook listeners for Canvas LMS events.

The webhook listener receives real-time notifications from Canvas for
various events like assignment creation, submission updates, grade changes,
enrollment changes, and more.

The listener provides:
  - JWT verification for Canvas Data Services (recommended)
  - HMAC signature verification for custom integrations
  - Event routing to specific handlers
  - Graceful shutdown
  - Health check endpoint
  - Request logging

Examples:
  # Start with Canvas Data Services JWT verification (recommended)
  canvas webhook listen --canvas-data-services

  # Start with HMAC signature verification
  canvas webhook listen --secret your-secret-key

  # Start with custom JWK URL
  canvas webhook listen --jwks-url https://your-jwks-endpoint.com/jwks

  # Listen for specific event types
  canvas webhook listen --events submission_created,grade_change

  # List available event types
