## canvas assignments list

List assignments in a course

### Synopsis

List all assignments in a Canvas course.

You can filter assignments by search term, bucket, and order.

Buckets:
  - past: Assignments that are past their due date
  - overdue: Assignments that are overdue for the current user
  - undated: Assignments that have no due date
  - ungraded: Assignments that have not been graded
  - unsubmitted: Assignments that have not been submitted
  - upcoming: Assignments that are due in the future
  - future: Assignments with a due date in the future

Examples:

```bash
canvas assignments list --course-id 123
canvas assignments list --course-id 123 --bucket upcoming
canvas assignments list --course-id 123 --search "quiz"
canvas assignments list --course-id 123 --order-by due_at
canvas assignments list --course-id 123 --include submission,rubric
```

Note: If you have set a course context (canvas context set course 123),
you can omit --course-id and it will be used automatically.
